        <p>Gluten Free all Day!  Come and try Aunt Janes Ugly Scones, Crustless Quiche, Flourless Chocolate Cake, and many other delicious treats!</p>
        <p><em>We are closed Sunday and Monday.  Because we know flour particles can float in the air for up to 24 hrs., we reserve Tuesday as an exclusively gluten free day.  All items are baked fresh Tuesday morning and using utensils that are kept stored away in a plastic tub during the rest of the week.</em></p>
