          I just wanted to thank you on behalf of our family for the beautiful cake you all made and delivered for my parents-in-law 60th anniversary!
          We all appreciated the cake and there was more than enough to go around. Both the cake and frosting had delicious flavor.
          I know we had to set this up at the last minute so I am grateful for everything you did to make it happen. It was there and ready for us right on time.<br>
          Thank you again!

          I still wanted to thank you so very much for the beautiful architecture graduation cake you made for Matthew's celebration last month! We all enjoyed our yummy dessert that night and truly appreciated your time and effort in creating it! You did a great job! Also, I thought you'd enjoy a couple of pictures of your cake and Matt giving you his approval!<br>
          Have a fantastic week, Alicia. I hope your business is going great and that you are having fun and all is well in your life.<br>
          God bless you always!

          The cake was amazing. I teared up when I got the reveal at the pickup. My dad really, really loved it and was blown away when he saw it. His friend that helped him work on the car was at the party, so it was pretty special to share it with him too. Thank you so much for taking me on as a last minute client. Your talent is incredible, and I don't know that my email is able to convey my appreciation for your work.
