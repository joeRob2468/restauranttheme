<p>Sanctuary. <strong>Peace</strong>. Laughter. <strong>Joy</strong>. Freedom. All of these my Grandmother, who was bound to a wheelchair later in life, found in a simple forest glade on my Grandpa Joeâ€™s farm outside of Valley Falls, KS. She called it <strong>The Laughing Place</strong>. This is my Laughing Place. May you experience the very same <strong>Blessings </strong>here.
